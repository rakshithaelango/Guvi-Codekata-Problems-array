You are given with an array. For each element present in the array your task is to print the next smallest than that number. If it is not smallest print -1
Sample Input :
7
10 7 9 3 2 1 15
Sample Output :
7 3 3 2 1 -1 -1



a = int(input())
c = []
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
for i in range (a):
    value = 0
    for j in range(i, a):
        if arr[i] > arr[j]:
            value = arr[j]
            break
        else:
            value = -1
    c.append(value)
print(*c)
